## üß† AI Integration

This application leverages the power of the Google Gemini API to provide rich, dynamically generated content. When you click on the "Generate" buttons for sections like "Word in Context Story," "Quiz Question," or "Cross-Language Translation," the application makes a call to the Gemini API with a specific prompt based on the currently displayed word. The AI then processes this request and returns relevant text or structured data (like quiz questions or translation details), enhancing your learning experience beyond static dictionary entries.

## üîë How to Get a Gemini API Key

To run this application with full AI functionality, you'll need a Google Gemini API key. Follow these steps:

1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:** Visit <https://aistudio.google.com/>.

2.  **Sign In:** Sign in with your Google account.

3.  **Create API Key:**

    * In the left sidebar, click "Get API Key" or "Create API Key."

    * You might need to create a new project first if you haven't done so.

    * Copy the generated API key.

4.  **Integrate the Key:** In the `index.html` file, find the line:

    ```javascript
    const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
    ```

    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with the actual API key you obtained from Google AI Studio. **Note:** In a Canvas environment, the `apiKey` variable (`""`) is often automatically provided or handled by the environment, so direct modification might not be necessary if running within such a platform. However, for local development outside Canvas, you would replace it.

## üíª Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/vocabulary-checker-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/vocabulary-checker-app.git)
    ```

    (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if you fork it)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd vocabulary-checker-app
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No local server is required.

4.  **Enter a word** in the input field and click "Search Word".

5.  **Explore** the detailed information and click "Generate" buttons for AI-powered content.

6.  Use "Save Current Word" to store words and "Load Saved Words" to retrieve them.
